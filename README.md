# CS Stuff

Here is some code mainly focused on [data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure), [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm), and computer science stuff.

> These data structures and algorithms were not supposed to be used in production environments.

    - [x] Binary Search Tree (BST)
    - [x] Hashtable
    - [x] Graphs (adjacency matrix and list)
- **Algorithms**
